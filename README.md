## Installation

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+ and an API key from [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/) (free tier available, paid plan recommended — see [API Plans](#the-odds-api) below)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WalrusQuant/oddsapi.git
cd oddsapi
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Copy the example env file and add your API key:

## The Odds API

This app requires an API key from [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/). The free tier includes 500 credits per month, but these get used up quickly — the **$30/month plan (20,000 credits)** is recommended.

## Player Props

Press `p` to switch to the player props view. Props are fetched concurrently across all events for the selected sport and displayed with:

- **Player name**, prop type, and Over/Under lines from each book
- **NOVIG** column — fair no-vig odds derived from the market consensus
- **EV%** column — inline expected value of the best available price
- **Best price** highlighted across all books

Use `t` to filter by specific prop markets. Available markets vary by sport:

| Sport | Markets |
|-------|---------|
| NBA | PTS, REB, AST, 3PT, PRA |
| NFL | PaYd, PaTD, RuYd, ReYd, Rec, ATD |
| MLB | HR, Hits, TB, K |
| NHL | Goal, AST, SOG |

### DFS Books

DFS platforms (PrizePicks, Underdog, Pick6, Betr) are supported with configurable effective odds to account for multi-leg pricing differences. Set overrides in `settings.yaml`:

```yaml
dfs_books:
  prizepicks: -137
  underdog: -137
  pick6: -137
  betr_us_dfs: -137
```

## +EV Detection

Toggle the EV panel with `e` to see bets where a bookmaker's odds exceed the fair market price. The panel shows +EV opportunities for both game lines and player props.

![EV Panel](assets/ev-panel.png)

The engine uses **market-average no-vig consensus pricing** to estimate fair odds:

1. Collects odds from all available bookmakers for each outcome
2. Converts to implied probabilities and averages across books
3. Removes the vig (normalizes probabilities to sum to 1.0)
4. Compares each book's actual odds against the derived fair odds
5. Flags bets where EV% exceeds the configured threshold (default 2%)

For player props, Over/Under pairs are normalized independently per (player, market, line) to prevent inflated EV calculations.

Requires at least 3 books contributing to the market average for reliability. Only pre-game lines are evaluated.

## Arbitrage Detection

Toggle the arb panel with `a` to see guaranteed-profit opportunities where the sum of implied probabilities across two books is less than 100%.

Each arb row shows:

- **Profit %** — guaranteed return regardless of outcome
- **Book A / Book B** — which sportsbooks to place each leg
- **Leg A / Leg B** — outcome, line, and odds for each side
- **Bet A / Bet B** — recommended wager amounts (Leg A fixed at $100, Leg B sized to equalize payout)
- **Payout** — guaranteed return in dollars
- **Profit$** — guaranteed profit in dollars

Arbs are detected across all markets including alternate lines when enabled. Only pre-game events are evaluated.

## Middles Detection

Toggle the middles panel with `m` to see cross-line opportunities where different books offer different lines, creating a window where both bets can win.

For example: Over 220.5 at Book A and Under 222.5 at Book B — if the total lands on 221 or 222, both legs win.

Each middle row shows:

- **EV%** — expected value accounting for hit probability
- **HIT%** — estimated probability of landing in the middle window (based on sport-specific scoring density)
- **WIN** — window size (number of points in the middle)
- **Bet A / Bet B** — recommended wager amounts (Leg A fixed at $100, Leg B sized to equalize the miss scenario)
- **HIT$** — profit if the middle hits (both legs win)
- **MISS$** — profit/loss if the middle misses (one wins, one loses)

Middles are detected on spreads and totals markets. The MISS$ column is color-coded green when you still profit on a miss (also an arb) or red when you take a small loss compensated by the larger hit payout.

## Configuration

## API Credit Usage

The Odds API uses a credit system. The app tracks your remaining credits via response headers and adjusts behavior:

- **Normal** — Fetches odds, scores, and props on configured intervals
- **Low credits** (< 50 remaining) — Yellow warning in status bar
- **Critical** (< 10 remaining) — All API calls pause; cached data continues to display
- **Props guard** — Props fetching pauses at 3x the critical threshold since each sport requires multiple per-event API calls
